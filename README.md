                  # World_Pollution_Report_2023
**Objective Summary**: 2023 Pollution report by different regions of the world.

**Description and Insight**: According to the data, Bangladesh has a pollution count of 83.3, making it the most polluted country in Asia and the world. The average pollution level in Asia is 1211.05. The chart also indicates whether a nation is a member of the UN. On average, Oceania countries such as New Zealand and Australia have a lower overall pollution level of 15.52 compared to other continents. UN members Iceland and the Bahamas have the least pollution in Europe and North America, respectively.

*Radial Tree/Radial Map: The radial tree is a type of information graphic that displays a tree structure, expanding outward. It is not based on any algorithm or algebraic function. The layout has been designed to convey the story with a visually balanced structure.*


**Programming Language**:  --


**Tool**: Flourish

**Performance Outcome**: Radial maps dsitort the distance percepttion and node size, reduces the readability for detailed comparison. It is not a effective chart to use where precise quantification is needed over visual hierarchy. It's useful for visualizing complex hierarchical structures, like organizational charts or file directories, in a compact, aesthetic format. The chart doesn't give any information about different types of pollution in each country. The challenge remain in maintaining and balancing economic growth with environmental protection.
